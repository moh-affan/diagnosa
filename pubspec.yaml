  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/stetoskop.png
    - images/diagnosa.jpg
    - images/menu_diagnosa.png
    - images/menu_penyakit.png
    - images/p001.jpg
    - images/p002.jpg
    - images/p003.jpg
    - images/p004.jpg
    - images/p005.jpg
    - images/p006.jpg
    - images/p007.jpg
    - images/p008.jpg
    - images/p009.jpg
    - images/p010.jpg
    - images/p011.jpg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/montserrat_regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/montserrat_bold.ttf
          weight: 700
  #       style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
